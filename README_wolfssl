wolfSSL library can be used in replacement of OpenSSL in the OpenSSH 6.6-p1
version. In that case, only the protocol version 2 is supported by OpenSSH. We
describe here the installation procedure for wolfSSL and OpenSSH.

-----------------------
MAC OS X, Fedora 32bits
-----------------------
I. Make wolfSSL with the support of extra functions
    1. configure wolfSSL:
		a. ./autogen.sh
        b. ./configure --enable-openssh --prefix=/usr/local
    2. compile the library:
        make clean && make
    3. do the test suite:
		make test
    4. install the library:
        sudo make install

II. Make OpenSSH with the support of wolfSSL in replacement of OpenSSL
    1. configure OpenSSH:
        a. autoreconf
		b. ./configure --with-wolfssl=/usr/local --with-pam
    2. compile ssh tools:
        make clean && make
    3. do the test suite:
        a. to activate tests that used SUDO, uncomment the line #SUDO=`which sudo` in regress/test-exec.sh
		b. make tests
    4. install the tools (optionnal)
        sudo make install

--------------------------------
Extra configuration for MAC OS X
--------------------------------
The OS X sandbox for renderer processes does not allow /dev/urandom to be opened.
wolfSSL relies on /dev/urandom for entropy, including the generation of keys used
for the peer-to-peer SSH negotiation/session establishment. If you would use the
sandboxing mechanism, you must explictly enable the access on /dev/urandom.

Add the two lines :
    (allow file-read* (literal \"/dev/random\")"
    (literal \"/dev/urandom\"))"
at the end of file '/System/Library/Sandbox/Profiles/org.openssh.sshd.sb'.

Remark: The OpenSSH testsuite include a test (connect-privsep.sh) that use
sandboxing. This one will failed if you don't update previously the MAC OS X
system file

--------------
Fedora 64 bits
--------------
I. Make wolfSSL with the support of extra functions. It is required to the
specifiy the library installation directory because the default one is not
included in the LIBRARY_PATH of Fedora 64 bits

    1. configure wolfSSL:
		a. ./autogen.sh
        b. ./configure --enable-openssh --prefix=/usr/local --libdir=/lib64
    2. compile the library:
        make clean && make
    3. do the test suite:
        make test
    4. install the library:
        sudo make install

II. Make OpenSSH with the support of wolfSSL in replacement of OpenSSL
    1. configure OpenSSH:
        a. autoreconf
		b. ./configure --with-wolfssl=/usr/local --with-pam
    2. compile ssh tools:
        make clean && make
    3. do the test suite:
        a. to activate tests that used SUDO, uncomment the line #SUDO=`which sudo` in regress/test-exec.sh
		b. make tests
    4. install the tools (optionnal)
        sudo make install
