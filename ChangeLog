Author: Darren Tucker <dtucker@dtucker.net>
Date:   7 days ago

    Prefer OpenSSL's SHA256 in sk-dummy.so
    
    Previously sk-dummy.so used libc's (or compat's) SHA256 since it may be
    built without OpenSSL.  In many cases, however, including both libc's
    and OpenSSL's headers together caused conflicting definitions.
    
    We tried working around this (on OpenSSL <1.1 you could define
    OPENSSL_NO_SHA, NetBSD had USE_LIBC_SHA2, various #define hacks) with
    varying levels of success.  Since OpenSSL >=1.1 removed OPENSSL_NO_SHA
    and including most OpenSSL headers would bring sha.h in, even if it
    wasn't used directly this was a constant hassle.
    
    Admit defeat and use OpenSSL's SHA256 unless we aren't using OpenSSL at
    all.  ok djm@

    Bring back OPENSSL_HAS_ECC to ssh-pkcs11-client

Author: djm@openbsd.org <djm@openbsd.org>
Date:   2 weeks ago

    upstream: Separate ssh-pkcs11-helpers for each p11 module
    
    Make ssh-pkcs11-client start an independent helper for each provider,
    providing better isolation between modules and reliability if a single
    module misbehaves.
    
    This also implements reference counting of PKCS#11-hosted keys,
    allowing ssh-pkcs11-helper subprocesses to be automatically reaped
    when no remaining keys reference them. This fixes some bugs we have
    that make PKCS11 keys unusable after they have been deleted, e.g.

Date:   2 weeks ago

    upstream: Disallow remote addition of FIDO/PKCS11 provider
    
    libraries to ssh-agent by default.
    
    The old behaviour of allowing remote clients from loading providers
    can be restored using `ssh-agent -O allow-remote-pkcs11`.
    
    Detection of local/remote clients requires a ssh(1) that supports
    the `session-bind@openssh.com` extension. Forwarding access to a
    ssh-agent socket using non-OpenSSH tools may circumvent this control.

    upstream: remove vestigal support for KRL signatures
    
    When the KRL format was originally defined, it included support for
    signing of KRL objects. However, the code to sign KRLs and verify KRL
    signatues was never completed in OpenSSH.
    
    Now, some years later, we have SSHSIG support in ssh-keygen that is
    more general, well tested and actually works. So this removes the
    semi-finished KRL signing/verification support from OpenSSH and
    refactors the remaining code to realise the benefit - primarily, we
    no longer need to perform multiple parsing passes over KRL objects.

    upstream: prepare for support for connecting to unix domain sockets
    
    using ssh -W by explicitly decoding PORT_STREAMLOCAL (a negative number) from
    the u32 that's passed over the multiplexing socket; previously code would
    just cast, which is UB.

commit 9de79df66d1430d290fab670bb4b18612875e518
Author: Philip Hands <phil@hands.com>
Date:   2 months ago

    if -s & -p specified, mention 'sftp -P' on success
    
    This was inspired by this:
     https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/321
    but I thought that it was better to not do the sed patching.
    
    BTW the reason one can get away with using $SSH_OPTS throughout, despite
    the lowercase -p in there, even if sftp is in use, is that the sftp call
    is using the already-established ssh master connection, so the port was
    passed to the earlier ssh.

    On Solaris 10 and older targets /bin/sh is not POSIX-compliant.
    Test -z `...` fails with error 'sh: test: argument expected'.
    Using quotes around backticks fixes this and doesn't break
    POSIX compatibility.

    Special case OpenWrt instead of Dropbear.
    
    OpenWrt overrides the location of authorized_keys for root.  Currently we
    assume that all Dropbear installations behave this way, which is not the
    case.  Check for OpenWrt and root user before using that location instead
    of assuming that for all Dropbear servers.  Prompted by Github PR#250.

    upstream: adjust ftruncate() logic to handle servers that reorder
    
    requests.
    
    sftp/scp will ftruncate the destination file after a transfer completes,
    to deal with the case where a longer destination file already existed.
    We tracked the highest contiguous block transferred to deal with this
    case, but our naive tracking doesn't deal with servers that reorder
    requests - a misfeature strictly permitted by the protocol but seldom
    implemented.
    
    Adjust the logic to ftruncate() at the highest absolute block received
    when the transfer is successful. feedback deraadt@ ok markus@

    upstream: Rework logging for the regression tests.
    
    Previously we would log to ssh.log and sshd.log, but that is insufficient
    for tests that have more than one concurent ssh/sshd.
    
    Instead, we'll log to separate datestamped files in a $OBJ/log/ and
    leave a symlink at the previous location pointing at the most recent
    instance with an entry in regress.log showing which files were created
    at each point.  This should be sufficient to reconstruct what happened
    even for tests that use multiple instances of each program.  If the test
    fails, tar up all of the logs for later analysis.
    
    This will let us also capture the output from some of the other tools
    which was previously sent to /dev/null although most of those will be
    in future commits.

Author: Damien Miller <djm@mindrot.org>
Date:   6 months ago

    harden Linux seccomp sandbox
    
    Linux mmap(2) and madvise(2) syscalls support quite a number of funky
    flags that we don't expect that sshd/libc will ever need. We can
    exclude this kernel attack surface by filtering the mmap(2) flags
    and the madvise(2) advice arguments.
    
    Similarly, the sandboxed process in sshd is a single-threaded program
    that does not use shared memory for synchronisation or communication.
    Therefore, there should be no reason for the advanced priority
    inheritance futex(2) operations to be necessary. These can also be
    excluded.
    
    Motivated by Jann Horn pointing out that there have been kernel bugs
    in nearby Linux kernel code, e.g. CVE-2020-29368, CVE-2020-29374 and
    CVE-2022-42703.

    be too fragile, we'll see if we need a different approach. The resulting sshd
    binary is tested with the new sshd -V option before installation.  As the
    binary layout is now semi-unknown (meaning relative, fixed, and gadget
    offsets are not precisely known), change the filesystem permissions to 511 to
    prevent what I call "logged in BROP". I have ideas for improving this further

    try to improve logging for dynamic-forward test
    
    previously the logs from the ssh used to exercise the forwarding
    channel would clobber the logs from the ssh actually doing the
    forwarding

Author: Darren Tucker <dtucker@dtucker.net>
Date:   7 months ago

    Skip dynamic-forward test on minix3.
    
    This test relies on loopback addresses which minix does not have.
    Previously the test would not run at all since it also doesn't have
    netcat, but now we use our own netcat it tries and fails.

    Use autoconf to find openssl binary.
    
    It's possible to install an OpenSSL in a path not in the system's
    default library search path.  OpenSSH can still use this (eg if you
    specify an rpath) but the openssl binary there may not work.  If one is
    available on the system path just use that.

    unbreak scp on NetBSD 4.x
    
    e555d5cad5 effectively increased the default copy buffer size for SFTP
    transfers. This caused NetBSD 4.x to hang during the "copy local file to
    remote file in place" scp.sh regression test.
    
    This puts back the original 32KB copy buffer size until we can properly
    figure out why.
    
    lots of debugging assistance from dtucker@

    upstream: Implement channel inactivity timeouts
    
    This adds a sshd_config ChannelTimeouts directive that allows channels that
    have not seen traffic in a configurable interval to be automatically closed.
    Different timeouts may be applied to session, X11, agent and TCP forwarding
    channels.
    
    Note: this only affects channels over an opened SSH connection and not
    the connection itself. Most clients close the connection when their channels
    go away, with a notable exception being ssh(1) in multiplexing mode.

Author: djm@openbsd.org <djm@openbsd.org>
Date:   7 months ago

    upstream: Add channel_force_close()
    
    This will forcibly close an open channel by simulating read/write errors,
    draining the IO buffers and calling the detach function.
    
    Previously the detach function was only ever called during channel garbage
    collection, but there was no way to signal the user of a channel (e.g.
    session.c) that its channel was being closed deliberately (vs. by the
    usual state-machine logic). So this adds an extra "force" argument to the
    channel cleanup callback to indicate this condition.

    upstream: New EnableEscapeCommandline ssh_config(5) option
    
    This option (default "no") controls whether the ~C escape is available.
    Turning it off by default means we will soon be able to use a stricter
    default pledge(2) in the client.

commit 62cc33e6eed847aafdc29e34aa69e9bd82a0ee16
Author: Darren Tucker <dtucker@dtucker.net>
Date:   8 months ago

    Use -fzero-call-used-regs=used on clang 15.
    
    clang 15 seems to have a problem with -fzero-call-used-reg=all which
    causes spurious "incorrect signature" failures with ED25519.  On those
    versions, use -fzero-call-used-regs=used instead.  (We may add exceptions
    later if specific versions prove to be OK).  Also move the GCC version
    check to match.
    
    Initial investigation by Daniel Pouzzner (douzzer at mega nu), workaround
    suggested by Bill Wendling (morbo at google com).  bz#3475, ok djm@

commit 9f2747e0bed3faca92679eae69aef10c95dc82f5
Author: Darren Tucker <dtucker@dtucker.net>
Date:   8 months ago

    Rework how selfhosted tests interact with runners.
    
    Previously there was one runner per test target (mostly VMs).  This had
    a few limitations:
     - multiple tests that ran on the same target (eg multiple build
       configs) were serialized on availability or that runner.
     - it needed manual balancing of VMs over host machines.
    
    To address this, make VMs that use ephemeral disks (ie most of them)
    all use a pool of runners with the "libvirt" label.  This requires that
    we distinguish between "host" and "target" for those.  Native runners
    and VMs with persistent disks (eg the constantly-updated snapshot ones)
    specify the same host and target.
    
    This should improve test throughput.

    Run vmstartup from temp dir.

commit 6b9bbbfe8b26db6e9a30a7e08c223e85421aed98
Author: Darren Tucker <dtucker@dtucker.net>
Date:   8 months ago

    If we haven't found it yet, recheck for sys/stat.h.
    
    On some very old platforms, sys/stat.h needs sys/types.h, however
    autoconf 2.71's AC_CHECK_INCLUDES_DEFAULT checks for them in the
    opposite order, which in combination with modern autoconf's
    "present but cannot be compiled" behaviour causes it to not be
    detected.

    prevent a delay on each connection as sshd reseeded itself.
    
    ssh-random-helper is long gone, and since the re-exec happens before the
    chroot the re-execed sshd can reseed itself normally. ok djm@

    Avoid assuming layout of fd_set
    
    POSIX doesn't specify the internal layout of the fd_set object, so let's
    not assume it is just a bit mask. This increases compatibility with
    systems that have a different layout.
    
    The assumption is also worthless as we already refuse to use file
    descriptors over FD_SETSIZE anyway. Meaning that the default size of
    fd_set is quite sufficient.

    upstream: sftp: Be a bit more clever about completions
    
    There are commands (e.g. "get" or "put") that accept two
    arguments, a local path and a remote path. However, the way
    current completion is written doesn't take this distinction into
    account and always completes remote or local paths.
    
    By expanding CMD struct and "cmds" array this distinction can be
    reflected and with small adjustment to completer code the correct
    path can be completed.

    from response
    
    Now that all FIDO signing calls attempt first without PIN and then
    fall back to trying PIN only if that attempt fails, we can remove the
    hack^wtrick that removed the UV flag from the keys returned during
    enroll.

    Do not link scp, sftp and sftp-server w/ zlib.
    
    Some of our binaries (eg sftp, sftp-server, scp) do not interact with

    by moving zlib into it, which means the aformentioned binaries are no

    Return ERANGE from getcwd() if buffer size is 1.
    
    If getcwd() is supplied a buffer size of exactly 1 and a path of "/", it
    could result in a nul byte being written out of array bounds.  POSIX says
    it should return ERANGE if the path will not fit in the available buffer
    (with terminating nul). 1 byte cannot fit any possible path with its nul,
    so immediately return ERANGE in that case.
    
    OpenSSH never uses getcwd() with this buffer size, and all current
    (and even quite old) platforms that we are currently known to work
    on have a native getcwd() so this code is not used on those anyway.

    Extend select+rlimit sanbox test to include poll.
    
    POSIX specifies that poll() shall fail if "nfds argument is greater
    than {OPEN_MAX}".  The setrlimit sandbox sets this to effectively zero
    so this causes poll() to fail in the preauth privsep process.
    
    This is likely the underlying cause for the previously observed similar
    behaviour of select() on plaforms where it is implement in userspace on
    top of poll().

commit b30698662b862f5397116d23688aac0764e0886e
Author: Darren Tucker <dtucker@dtucker.net>
Date:   1 year, 6 months ago

    Move SSHD_ACQUIRES_CTTY workaround into compat.
    
    On some (most? all?) SysV based systems with STREAMS based ptys,
    sshd could acquire a controlling terminal during pty setup when
    it pushed the "ptem" module, due to what is probably a bug in
    the STREAMS driver that's old enough to vote.  Because it was the
    privileged sshd's controlling terminal, it was not available for
    the user's session, which ended up without one.  This is known to
    affect at least Solaris <=10, derivatives such as OpenIndiana and
    several other SysV systems.  See bz#245 for the backstory.
    
    In the we past worked around that by not calling setsid in the
    privileged sshd child, which meant it was not a session or process
    group leader.  This solved controlling terminal problem because sshd
    was not eligble to acquire one, but had other side effects such as
    not cleaning up helper subprocesses in the SIGALRM handler since it
    was not PG leader.  Recent cleanups in the signal handler uncovered
    this, resulting in the LoginGraceTime timer not cleaning up privsep
    unprivileged processes.
    
    This change moves the workaround into the STREAMS pty allocation code,
    by allocating a sacrificial pty to act as sshd's controlling terminal
    before allocating user ptys, so those are still available for users'
    sessions.
    
    On the down side:
     - this will waste a pty per ssh connection on affected platforms.
    
    On the up side:
     - it makes the process group behaviour consistent between platforms.
    
     - it puts the workaround nearest the code that actually causes the
       problem and competely out of the mainline code.
    
     - the workaround is only activated if you use the STREAMS code.  If,
       say, Solaris 11 has the bug but also a working openpty() it doesn't
       matter that we defined SSHD_ACQUIRES_CTTY.
    
     - the workaround is only activated when the fist pty is allocated,
       ie in the post-auth privsep monitor.  This means there's no risk
       of fd leaks to the unprivileged processes, and there's no effect on
       sessions that do not allocate a pty.

    HEAD is not guaranteed to work on previous stable branches, and at the
    moment is broken due to libfido API changes.

    upstream: Switch hpdelim interface to accept only ":" as delimiter.
    
    Historicallly, hpdelim accepted ":" or "/" as a port delimiter between
    hosts (or addresses) and ports.  These days most of the uses for "/"
    are no longer accepted, so there are several places where it checks the
    delimiter to disallow it.  Make hpdelim accept only ":" and use hpdelim2
    in the other cases.  ok djm@

    Improve compatibility of early exit trap handling.
    
    Dash (as used by the github runners) has some differences in its trap
    builtin:
     - it doesn't have -p (which is fine, that's not in posix).
     - it doesn't work in a subshell (which turns out to be in compliance
       with posix, which means bash isn't).
     - it doesn't work in a pipeline, ie "trap|cat" produces no output.

    Invoke EXIT handler early when using Valgrind.
    
    When using Valgrind, we need to wait for all invoked programs to
    complete before checking their valgrind logs.  Some tests, notably
    agent-restrict, set an EXIT trap handler to clean up things like
    ssh-agent, but those do not get invoked until test-exec.sh exits.
    This causes the Valgrind wait to deadlock, so if present invoke
    the EXIT handler before checking the Valgrind logs.

    OS X poll(2) is broken; use compat replacement
    
    Darwin's poll(2) implementation is broken. For character-special
    devices like /dev/null, it returns POLLNVAL when polled with
    POLLIN.
    
    Apparently this is Apple bug 3710161, which is AFAIK not public,
    but a websearch will find other OSS projects rediscovering it
    periodically since it was first identified in 2005 (!!)

    upstream: PubkeyAuthentication=yes|no|unbound|host-bound
    
    Allow control over which pubkey methods are used. Added out of
    concern that some hardware devices may have difficulty signing
    the longer pubkey authentication challenges. This provides a
    way for them to disable the extension. It's also handy for
    testing.

    upstream: ssh-add side of destination constraints
    
    Have ssh-add accept a list of "destination constraints" that allow
    restricting where keys may be used in conjunction with a ssh-agent/ssh
    that supports session ID/hostkey binding.
    
    Constraints are specified as either "[user@]host-pattern" or
    "host-pattern>[user@]host-pattern".
    
    The first form permits a key to be used to authenticate as the
    specified user to the specified host.
    
    The second form permits a key that has previously been permitted
    for use at a host to be available via a forwarded agent to an
    additional host.
    
    For example, constraining a key with "user1@host_a" and
    "host_a>host_b". Would permit authentication as "user1" at
    "host_a", and allow the key to be available on an agent forwarded
    to "host_a" only for authentication to "host_b". The key would not
    be visible on agent forwarded to other hosts or usable for
    authentication there.
    
    Internally, destination constraints use host keys to identify hosts.
    The host patterns are used to obtain lists of host keys for that
    destination that are communicated to the agent. The user/hostkeys are
    encoded using a new restrict-destination-v00@openssh.com key
    constraint.
    
    host keys are looked up in the default client user/system known_hosts
    files. It is possible to override this set on the command-line.

    Requested by and mostly written by Fabian Stelzer, towards a TOFU
    model for SSH signatures in git. Some tweaks by me.

    Don't auto-enable Capsicum sandbox on FreeBSD 9/10.
    
    Since we changed from select() to ppoll() tests have been failing.
    This seems to be because FreeBSD 10 (and presumably 9) do not allow
    ppoll() in the privsep process and sshd will fail with "Not permitted in
    capability mode".  Setting CAP_EVENT on the FDs doesn't help, but weirdly,
    poll() works without that.  Those versions are EOL so this situation is
    unlikely to change.

    upstream: ssh-keygen -Y find-principals was verifying key validity
    
    when using ca certs but not with simple key lifetimes within the allowed
    signers file.
    
    Since it returns the first keys principal it finds this could
    result in a principal with an expired key even though a valid
    one is just below.

    Don't trust closefrom() on Linux.
    
    glibc's closefrom implementation does not work in a chroot when the kernel
    does not have close_range.  It tries to read from /proc/self/fd and when
    that fails dies with an assertion of sorts.  Instead, call close_range
    ourselves from our compat code and fall back if that fails.  bz#3349,

    upstream: Better handle FIDO keys on tokens that provide user
    
    verification (UV) on the device itself, including biometric keys.
    
    Query the token during key creation to determine whether it supports
    on-token UV and, if so, clear the SSH_SK_USER_VERIFICATION_REQD flag
    in the key so that ssh(1) doesn't automatically prompty for PIN later.
    
    When making signatures with the key, query the token's capabilities
    again and check whether the token is able (right now) to perform user-
    verification without a PIN. If it is then the PIN prompt is bypassed
    and user verification delegated to the token. If not (e.g. the token
    is biometric capable, but no biometric are enrolled), then fall back
    to user verification via the usual PIN prompt.

    upstream: For open/openat, if the flags parameter does not contain
    
    O_CREAT, the 3rd (variadic) mode_t parameter is irrelevant.  Many developers
    in the past have passed mode_t (0, 044, 0644, or such), which might lead
    future people to copy this broken idiom, and perhaps even believe this
    parameter has some meaning or implication or application. Delete them all.
    This comes out of a conversation where tb@ noticed that a strange (but
    intentional) pledge behaviour is to always knock-out high-bits from mode_t on
    a number of system calls as a safety factor, and his bewilderment that this
    appeared to be happening against valid modes (at least visually), but no
    sorry, they are all irrelevant junk.  They could all be 0xdeafbeef. ok

    upstream: Do not ignore SIGINT while waiting for input if editline(3)

    support in portable OpenSSH, the el == NULL branch is also used for
    interactive mode. In that case, discard the input line and provide a fresh
    prompt to the user just like in the case where editline(3) is used. OK djm@

    Fix race in pselect replacement code.
    
    On the second and subsequent calls to pselect the notify_pipe was not
    added to the select readset, opening up a race that om G. Christensen
    discovered on multiprocessor Solaris <=9 systems.
    
    Also reinitialize notify_pipe if the pid changes.  This will prevent a
    parent and child from using the same FD, although this is not an issue
    in the current structure it might be in future.

    Improve github test driver script.
    
     - use a trap to always output any failed regress logs (since the script
       sets -e, the existing log output is never invoked).

    upstream: In the editline(3) branch of the sftp(1) event loop,
    
    handle SIGINT rather than ignoring it, such that the user can use Ctrl-C to
    discard the currently edited command line and get a fresh prompt, just like
    in ftp(1), bc(1), and in shells.
    
    It is critical to not use ssl_signal() for this particular case
    because that function unconditionally sets SA_RESTART, but here we
    need the signal to interrupt the read(2) in the el_gets(3) event loop.

    overrides the LogLevel we set in the config files and suppresses output
    to the debug logs so drop any "-q" from the invoked ssh.  In the one
    case where we actually want to use -q in the banner test, call the ssh
    binary directly bypassing the logging wrapper.

    POSIX allows basename(3) to either return a pointer to static storage
    or modify the passed string and return a pointer to that.  OpenBSD does
    the former and works as is, but on other platforms "filename" points
    into "tmp" which was just freed.  This makes the freeing of tmp
    consistent with the other variable in the loop.

    upstream: support for using the SFTP protocol for file transfers in
    
    scp, via a new "-M sftp" option. Marked as experimental for now.
    
    Some corner-cases exist, in particular there is no attempt to
    provide bug-compatibility with scp's weird "double shell" quoting
    rules.
    
    Mostly by Jakub Jelen in GHPR#194 with some tweaks by me. ok markus@
    Thanks jmc@ for improving the scp.1 bits.
